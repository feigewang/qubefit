    "The goal of this tutorial is to fit a thin disk model to ALMA observations of a high redshift galaxy. Our scientific aim is to measure the rotational velocity and dispersion of the galaxy. For the data, we will be using the full calibrated continuum-subtracted data cube of the ionized carbon emission from a z=4.26 galaxy ('the Wolfe disk') described in [Neeleman et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09661). The emission from this galaxy appears to have a smooth velocity field, which is consistent with emission emitted by gas within a rotating disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this example, you will need to have access to the data. Currently the example file is part of the github code and lives in the `examples` folder, because it also is used to verify the code was installed correctly. This might change in future versions, in which case you will need to download the file and add it to the examples folder manually. The fits file `examples/WolfeDiskCube.fits` (15MB) is actually a sub-cube of the full continuum-subtracted data cube, which is signficantly larger (232MB). "
