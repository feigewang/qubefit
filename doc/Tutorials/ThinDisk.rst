Fitting a ThinDisk Model
===============================================
This tutorial is available as a python notebook.

In the next sections, these two steps are explained in detail and illustrated with the help of an example case. The example we will use is the fitting of a thin disk model with constant velocity and dispersion to ALMA observations of the ionized carbon emission line from a *z* = 4.26 galaxy (Neeleman et al. 2020, *Nature*, 581, 269). The emission from this galaxy appears to be disk-like, and our scientific goal is to constrain the kinematic properties of this galaxy.
